# ETH-Beginner-Submission

ETH-Proof-Beginner was a very good course for learning basics of Web3, Ethereum Ecosystem and the basics of Solidity. I learned about basics of programming in Solidity Language like Variables, Functions, Gas, etc. And using all these concepts the final challenge for this course is to make a new Token by Myself.

## Description

In this challenge, using all the concepts of solidity taught in the course, I have made my own Token named "Anagha", it's short form "ANG". And I have set it's initial supply to be zero. Then we have two functions, first being 'Mint', where any user can mint tokens on his/her address, the total supply and balances get added with the amount. And the second function is 'Burn' where the user can burn the tokens already present on his/her address only if there is enough balance.

## Getting Started
As taught in ETH-Proof-Beginner Course, I wrote this code in Solidity language, where I used different concepts like Struct, functions, if-else statements.

### Installing

* The code can be tested on an online IDE named Remix IDE, which is made for Solidity Smart Contract development and can be accessed directly through any browser.

### Executing program

* In Remix, we can directly compile any code through the side menu. Also there is a option for deploying the code right below the Compile button.
* After deploying, the contract can be tested there only, by giving the required inputs and see how it works.

## Help

For any doubts and help, I went through the Discord Channel of Metacrafters, there were many active members who solved each others' doubts, so it was really helpful.
